Hey! This is my first blog post and I'll be teaching how to use markdown language to make your notes cleaner and easy to read. This post is inspired by the blog [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and a random cheatsheet. I am writing this down while figuring out how to create this jekyll based github pages site.
