Hi! I'm **Gobind Singh**, an incoming 4th-year Computer Science undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in). Over the past few years, I've developed a deep passion for **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Large Language Models** through academic courses, hands-on projects, and extensive research paper exploration.

I've had the opportunity to intern at leading institutions such as [IIIT-Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in) under Prof. Uttam Kumar, where I explored problems in **Continual Learning**, and at [DeepTekAI](https://www.deeptek.ai) and [CSIR-CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/) with Dr. Sumeet Sourav, where I worked on multimodal **ECG data analysis**. Additionally, I gained practical software engineering experience during my internship at [Tekenlight Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.tekenlight.com).

I thrive on solving challenging problems, especially through collaboration. I’m particularly passionate about the intersection of **AI and Healthcare** and aspire to build a startup in this space. In the early stages of my career, I hope to work at a fast-paced startup to gain holistic experience—both technical and strategic.

Beyond academics, I’m a **high-energy individual** with a deep love for **basketball**. I've had the privilege of captaining my college team and leading us to multiple victories. I also enjoy engaging in thoughtful discussions—be it about strategy, popular theories, or a dash of philosophy.
