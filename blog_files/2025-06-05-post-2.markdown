# Hey! ✍️ This one's going to be about writing down stuff and what I have learnt from it.

Throughout my journey in college, I have faced difficult situations in which I may have had to take a crucial decision or I have had to think through something systematically. In these situations, I have tried my best (although accidently) to maintain a balance between decisions which I have thoroughly thought about and decisions which I have taken a step-back, written it down and then acted systematically. I've realized that the latter one proves to be way more efficient and has mostly worked to my favor. I'm below going to say some of my personal stories to make this claim even stronger. 🧠

In this last semester, I had somehow gotten myself into a great deal of non-academic mind troubles 🌀 which made me think a lot in order for me to solve them (slowly you'll get to know, I'm an emotional person 💭). I realized that there is a great deal of difference in action and assurance when you think about a certain topic versus when you write about the topic. 

I spent a majority of my time not thinking about the situation I am in and how to go about it, but rather discussing it with people and getting their viewpoints and ideas on it. Instead, if you go about writing it down ✏️ and practically analyzing possibilities, you will come down to a very rationally strong answer and an assurance to go ahead with it in your mind ✅.

Another example is my habit of making a timetable for everything I want to do 🗓️: Throughout my time in college, I have always had multiple tasks and targets that I want to acheive at the same time. I have gotten my fare share succeeding at them and failing at them (failing mostly lol! 😅), and I have come to a conclusion that my timetables or my plans work when I have physically written them down somewhere (not typed!! this might just be me personally, but hey! it works!). 

Writing always gives me this sense of ground-base to work with, to always fall back to and lets me materialize rationally what thoughts are running in my mind. I can say for a fact that writing something down when you are tired or unsure about something, will definitely feel a 💯 times better than just thinking about it.

I don't enjoy writing as much 💤. It isnt my natural thing to do as it requires that extra work, picking up a pen, typing stuff down and often I keep myself just thinking about the things that I want to do. Maybe this blog is way for me to try to keep this habit going 🙂. I can keep up with my brain and engage in deep thinking occassionaly 🧘.

### 📝 Recommendations:
1. Compare your attitude towards going about a certain task by two ways: the first one being – spend a good 30 minutes thinking about it and the second one being – writing it down clearly and thinking about it for 30 minutes.  
   ✅ Trust me, you'll see a difference.

2. Writing improves your comprehension, vocabulary as well 📚 (GRE grind for Masters!! 😤).
