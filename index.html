<div class="home">

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Gobind Singh, and I am an incoming 4th year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. I love solving puzzles and thinking about new ideas. This site is to just jot them down and discuss with them with the world, so feel free to hit me up anytime :) !<br><br>

I maintain a list of research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
