Here is a non-exhaustive list of my non-research and college projects. My research work can be found <a href="/research">here</a>. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/gobind-singh23/">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Lexical Analyzer and Parser</b>: Implemented a lexical analyzer and parser with error recovery (LL-1) from scratch! This project was a part of the compiler construction course offered here at BITS Pilani. The lexical analyzer created tokens for the parser and was done for a particular language given by our course instructor.<br>

	<li>
		<b>U-Net Flood Mapping </b>: Implemented U-Net architecture for segmentation in flood mapping data collected from <a href = "https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus</a> website. Evaluated different metrics to analyze the performance of the model such as IOU score <br>

	<li>
		<b>College Coding</b>: Created a simple streamlit application that web scrapes (manual) data from codeforces api endpoints and populates a mongodb database. The data is then used to further process queries in different formats. It also uses an index to bring out similar questions from a user pasted codeforces question. Used a publicly available dataset to implement this feature. Working on this more currently to make it look better :).<br>

		<b>Arrhythmia Detection in ECG data</b>: Used MIT-BIH dataset to train a CNN and SVM classifier to detect arrhythmia in ECG data. This was done as a course project. <br>
