	<li>
		<b>Lexical Analyzer and Parser</b>: Implemented a lexical analyzer and parser with error recovery (LL-1) from scratch! This project was a part of the compiler construction course offered here at BITS Pilani. The lexical analyzer created tokens for the parser and was done for a particular language given by our course instructor.
